Driven by massive frustration with having to try and diagnose a customer's problems from an experience they had through the browser
Whilst using ES. Being unable to see what the customer saw in the way that the customer saw it, trying to diagnose performance problems or 
rendering issues is really hard.

Or at least, it was.. (in theory)

I am going to build a tool that allows us to do a few things.

1. Visually explore gigantic HAR files in the terminal
2. Run a replay server that will replay every response in sequence back to the browser.
3. Set breakpoints on responses and pause the conversation anywhere.

Being able to inspect and replay the HAR file using the UI should allow us to see what a customer saw. 

Will it work? I don't know, but we are going to find out.
